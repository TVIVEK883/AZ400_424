    <h2>About This Page</h2>
    <p>
        This simple single‑page application is built using a lightweight .NET setup,
        designed to demonstrate how quickly you can go from a basic “Hello World”
        endpoint to a clean, modern webpage. The goal is to keep things minimal while
        still showing how real‑world web apps can be structured.
    </p>

    <p>
        The page is served using .NET’s built‑in static file hosting, which makes it
        easy to add HTML, CSS, images, and even JavaScript without needing a full
        MVC or Razor Pages setup. This approach is perfect for small projects,
        prototypes, internal tools, or learning exercises where simplicity matters
        more than heavy frameworks.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can extend this page however you like—add navigation links, create
        additional sections, include interactive elements, or connect it to APIs.
        Because the underlying .NET app is minimal, you have full control over how
        the frontend and backend evolve. It’s a great foundation for experimenting,
        learning, or building something uniquely yours.
    </p>

    <p>
        As you continue expanding this project, you’ll discover how flexible .NET
        can be for both small and large applications. Whether you're building a
        personal portfolio, a dashboard, or a full‑scale web service, this simple
        starting point can grow with you.
